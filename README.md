# Breast-Cancer-Detection-using-Logistic-Regression
This project uses Logistic Regression to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on features extracted from a breast cancer dataset.
The model is trained using Python and Scikit-learn, and the goal is to evaluate the model's performance and make predictions for new data.

Features
Binary Classification: Predicts whether a tumor is Malignant (0) or Benign (1).
Model: Logistic Regression.
Dataset: Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset (available in Scikit-learn).
